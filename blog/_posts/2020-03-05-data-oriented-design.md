- Introduction to both object-oriented design and data-oriented design.

- Discuss the trade-offs between the two paradigms. What are the benefits of data-oriented design and why are some people skeptical of its merits for general-purpose programming?

- Show a code example of what a real-world system (data and algorithms in a stock portfolio management system possibly? wanted to try an example that wasn't video game / graphics rendering) may look like when implemented using a data-oriented approach compared to an object-oriented approach. This includes code snippets.

- Explain why the data-oriented solution (hopefully) provides benefits in terms of utilizing locality and providing other low-level efficiencies.

- Compare the performance of the two implementations using some method of benchmarking.

- Analyze the results of the benchmarking.

- (Conclusion) Convey the takeway of the blog post and provide resources for continued learning.
